# Dependency Boundaries

## Purpose

Every [workspace](../DICTIONARY.md#workspace) owns one deny-by-default
`boundaries.config.mjs`. An edge permits an import; it does not grant behavioral
authority. Package manifests never grant architectural permission.

## Current Workspace Dependencies

No workspace or local boundary map has been implemented, so there are no
package dependency edges. The accepted `apps/booking-system-web` and
`packages/booking` targets do not pre-authorize a JavaScript import.

## Current Responsibility Modules

`admin-access`, `course-structure`, `course-access`, and `module-participation`
are accepted as conceptual responsibility modules within the planned booking
package. No source module, dependency edge, boundary-map entry, or composition
file exists yet; those permissions require the concrete implementation change.

## Map Shape

Each map explicitly declares:

- `workspaceName`;
- `workspacePackagePattern`, the package namespace whose undeclared imports are
  rejected;
- `sourceRoot`;
- `allowedWorkspaceDependencies`;
- first-level `modules` and their allowed outgoing module edges; and
- root `compositionFiles` and the modules each may import.

Cross-workspace imports use the exact destination package root. Relative
traversal, package subpaths, undeclared workspace packages, unknown local files,
cross-module implementation imports, and production-to-test imports are
rejected.

## Activation Rule

When adding a workspace:

1. Create its package manifest and local `boundaries.config.mjs` map.
2. Import that map explicitly in `eslint.config.mjs`.
3. Add one explicit `createWorkspaceBoundaryConfig` call for its path.
4. Document the workspace and all permitted edges here.

Never scan workspace folders or package manifests to generate registrations or
permissions.

## Change Rule

Update a workspace map and this document in the same conceptual change when:

- a workspace appears or disappears;
- a first-level `src/` responsibility appears or disappears;
- an internal dependency edge changes;
- a workspace dependency is introduced or removed;
- the package namespace pattern changes; or
- a composition file's permission changes.
